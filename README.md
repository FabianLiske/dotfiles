# My dotfiles
Just my configs and some installation scripts. This setup assumes an Arch Installation with nothing but GPU drivers. No WM, no DE. Just run [installer.sh](/installer.sh), but carefully check the script before doing so. You are most likely not me so you will be unhappy when running the full deployment.

## To Do
- [ ] Write decent README
- [ ] Check current encryption setup (I forgor)
- [ ] Add Public RKs
- [ ] Encrypt(?) and add Private RK-Stubs
